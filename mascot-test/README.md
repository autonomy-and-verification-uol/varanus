## mascot-test

Various test traces for the MASCOT system, and two 'dummy' MASCOTs that just send events from a given trace file to Varanus. `dummy_mascot_socket.py` sends the events down a socket, and predictably, `dummy_mascot_websocket.py` send the events using websockets.

The "Scenarios" folder contains the traces for the larger scenarios used in the paper "Monitoring Robotic Systems using CSP: From Safety Designs to Safety Monitors".
